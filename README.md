# unison-codebase

This is where I push all my [Unison](https://www.unison-lang.org/) code!

## Organization
Based on the [recommendation here](https://www.unisonweb.org/docs/codebase-organization/)

## Projects

### graphqlclient
Attempting to take a first stab at a graphqlclient library using the current state of the unison ecosystem.

To pull the code into your unison codebase, run this in ucm:
`pull https://github.com/tapegram/unison-codebase:.graphqlclient .graphqlclient`

This will pull the changes into a namespace call `graphqlclient` at the top level of your codebase.
